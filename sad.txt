the end

veil - i was introduced to the world of com related activities through a stock discord server back in june 2024. that summer was a real eye opener i learned a ton about how people behave, the wild variety of personalities you meet. but as summer wrapped up, i stepped away for a month.
in september 2024, i connected with a guy who became a good friend. he pulled me back into those com servers and circles, and i got interested again. that’s when i got back into l*ing with more interest, and i even built my first tool. it was pretty basic, but it worked good at the time, and showing it off gave me this rush of dopamine. my involvement was on and off back then i still had a real life outside of it.
fast forward to february 2025: a close friend from outside the com scene messaged me and introduced me to justin. that’s when everything changed. justin had this big passion; he was using the old ctrl a, and he wasn’t a big name yet. bonding with someone who shared so many similarities opened my eyes there was more to it than just using tools. i started creating my own, realizing i could make scripts using ai. i already had some basics in html, javascript, and css.
from there, things went downward. i tried reclaiming my old self, focusing on motivation and making money, but hanging around justin and the people i met through him dragged me lower. after about four months, i found a new group of friends people i connected with via justin, but from communities i’d been part of before. they were different; i could just hang out with them without needing to l* for entertainment. for a while, it felt good, like i’d found balance.
but a mistake on my end ruined it all after another four months. by september 2025, i’d reconnected with justin. we got the flasher up and running with some scripts, and we had fun for a bit. eventually, the fun faded, and i quit flashing altogether.
this story focuses in on the l* related side of things, but my life hasn’t always revolved around it. i can’t say the same for justin. through all of this, i’ve stayed in touch with the friend who first introduced me to him we’ve known each other for years, and he’s been a true friend. together, we’ve decided it’s time to cut ties with all of this. it sucks you in, masquerading as joy, but there’s no real upside. i’m ready to leave it behind, and sharing this is my step toward that.
